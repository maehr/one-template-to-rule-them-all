    "text": "GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 3, 19 November 2007\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n                        Preamble\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nA secondary benefit of defending all users’ freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nDefinitions.\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others’ Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nRemote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n                 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\nCopyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\nby the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a “Source” link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "section": "Developing an Open Research Data Template",
    "text": "Developing an Open Research Data Template\nTo implement best practices across the research data lifecycle, we developed the Open Research Data Template (Mähr and Twente 2023) – a modular, GitHub-based framework designed to streamline the publication, documentation, and reuse of open research data.1 The motivation arose from a common challenge: even as more datasets are shared openly, the preprocessing steps, methodological decisions, and potential pathways for reuse are often poorly documented, rendering much “open data” difficult to actually reuse. Our template directly addresses this gap by enabling researchers (and our team) to package data with its context and code, not in isolation.\n\nDesign Principles and Technologies\nThe template is explicitly built around the guidelines from The Turing Way (The Turing Way Community 2025) to ensure that data and documentation are maximally reusable. Central to the approach is Quarto, an open-source publishing system designed for reproducible research. Quarto is the language-agnostic successor to RMarkdown and is built on Pandoc, extending it with native support for literate programming across multiple languages. Authors write in plain text (.qmd files) combining Markdown, YAML metadata, and optional executable code cells. At render time, Quarto executes these cells and weaves narrative, code, and output into multiple formats – HTML websites, PDFs, Word documents, or slides – from a single source.\nQuarto’s key advantage is its ability to embed and execute code chunks from Python, R, Julia, or JavaScript (Observable) within the same document. This keeps narrative text, data analysis, and visualizations in sync and reproducible. Compared with alternatives like Jupyter Book or MkDocs, Quarto is lightweight, easier to configure for researchers, and designed for scholarly publishing, with built-in support for citations, cross-references, figure numbering, and multi-format output. This multi-language interoperability and automated rendering are heavily leveraged in the template to turn static documentation into interactive, living resources.\nWe leveraged GitHub as both the development platform and the publishing infrastructure.2 Each project’s repository can be based on the template, benefiting from automated version control and collaboration. GitHub Actions (continuous integration workflows) handle routine tasks such as building the site, running tests (e.g., linting, validating links, generating changelogs, etc.), and deploying updates to GitHub Pages for hosting. This means that when contributors push changes (for example, updating a dataset or its analysis code), the website regenerates automatically, ensuring the latest information is always live without manual intervention. The template also integrates with Zenodo for long-term archiving: whenever a project using the template is ready to publish a snapshot (for instance, alongside a paper or at a project milestone), a Zenodo deposit can be generated, minting a DOI for that version. This guarantees both accessibility and citability for the materials, as datasets and documentation snapshots receive persistent identifiers. By combining static webpages with archival DOIs, the template bridges the gap between ephemeral project websites and permanent scholarly records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Setup and structure of the Open Research Data Template repository, demonstrating how to create a new repository, open it in a codespace, follow the setup checklist, and explore the repository contents.\n\n\n\nA key innovation of our approach is treating documentation as a living, executable environment rather than a static afterthought. Traditionally, projects might release data as supplementary files and methods as PDF documentation, but our template merges static metadata, narrative descriptions, and executable code into a single integrated and interactive website. This ensures that data, methods, and results remain interconnected and in context (Rule et al. 2019). Anyone revisiting the project can not only read about what was done but also see (and run) the actual code that produced the results, all within the documentation. This transparency lowers barriers to reuse: a future researcher can reproduce or adapt the workflow in their environment, confident that nothing is lost in translation. In essence, the template turns what would be static data archives into “living, extensible resources,” continuously usable and updatable beyond the original project.\n### Features and Best Practices\nThe Open Research Data Template comes with a set of best practices built in. It enforces a standardized, logical repository structure for organizing data, code, and content, building on The Turing Way handbook on reproducible research (The Turing Way Community 2025). Key features include:\n\nExecutable Narratives: Authors can create documents that directly incorporate code outputs (tables, plots, maps, etc.) into the narrative. Quarto’s support for Jupyter and other kernels means the documentation itself can regenerate analyses if data or parameters change. This ensures that analysis results and figures are always in sync with the latest data and code, exemplifying reproducible research practices.\n\nAutomated Deployment and Testing: By using continuous integration, the template reduces the technical overhead for researchers. For example, when writing documentation in markdown or Jupyter notebooks, authors simply commit their work; the template’s GitHub Actions workflows then automatically runs any code (in a controlled environment), builds the static site, checks for issues, and publishes it. This encourages frequent updates and iterative improvement without requiring web development expertise.\n\nIntegrated Archiving with DOI: The template streamlines the process of archiving each release of a project. When ready, a release triggers the Zenodo integration to archive the full repository (data, code, and site content) and issue a DOI. The live site can prominently display these DOIs, signaling to visitors that they can cite a specific version or access an immutable copy for reference. This was crucial for us in an evolving long-term project, as it provides snapshots for future historians to cite, even as the live documentation continues to evolve.\n\nScalability and Consistency: Because the template is a reusable scaffold, it brings consistency across projects. Every project site built with it has a similar navigation and structure (with sections for data, documentation, references, etc.), lowering the learning curve for users. It also makes it easier to onboard new team members or external collaborators to the project’s workflow. As we and others have applied the template, we have benefited from community feedback and contributions (via GitHub) that continue to refine the template’s core. The result is a scalable solution that can fit small one-off studies as well as large, multi-year collaborative projects.\n\nBy adhering to these principles and features, the template provides a practical model for elevating the standard of open data publication in the Digital Humanities. It helps researchers move beyond minimal compliance with open data mandates (i.e., just uploading files to a repository) toward creating genuinely reusable and transparent research outputs (Diekjobst et al. 2024). In the next section, we discuss how deploying this template across diverse use cases has improved it and demonstrated its versatility.",

    "text": "Applications and Continuous Improvement Across Use Cases\nAfter developing the Open Research Data Template for our own needs in Stadt.Geschichte.Basel, we adopted it in a variety of other contexts. Each deployment provided an opportunity to test the template’s flexibility and to refine features for broader applicability. Below, we describe several use cases – ranging from documentation portals and research repositories to teaching materials and digital publications – highlighting the functionality enabled by the template and the specific purposes each served.\n\nProject Documentation\nAt the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project, we needed a place for documenting our work related to research data management and public history – in addition to the pre-existing public history portal and research data platform that focus on the project content and data itself. To have a repository for archiving our products and showing them to our peers, including more technical aspects of the project, we used the template to create a documentation platform (Mähr, Schnegg, and Twente 2024). The site thus serves as an evolving record of how we handle data and digital outputs within the project and how we discuss it with our scientific peers. It includes sections on data creation, annotation, publication, and reuse, as well as our efforts in preparing historical content for digital presentation. For instance, we showcase how our project’s research data platform came to be, including documentation of our data model and the results of web design performance audits. While our code itself is still available on GitHub, the documentation platform serves as an enhanced repository where design choices and programming workflows can be explained in detail. By using our Quarto template, we could also provide interactive and multiformat versions of our products to make it easier to grasp their main features, rendering them easily reusable in other projects. During the project, our team participated in numerous presentations and publications discussing our work within the academic community. Each talk, paper, poster, etc. is also archived on this platform: abstracts, slides, and literature references are made available in one place, enabling cross-referencing in the future, with long-term access ensured by integrating Zenodo in our documentation workflow, including registered DOIs and external file storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Website of Stadt.Geschichte.Basel RDM presenting the team’s work on research data management, public history, and examples of good-practice products such as guides, workflows, and talks.\n\n\n\nFor the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project, we created a research data platform (Görlich et al. 2023) to provide project-related, annotated research data, including dozens of scientific illustrations created with ggplot2 in R. The plots are made available on this platform, but we wanted to ensure access to the underlying R code as well. We could have uploaded the R code to the platform, but we did not want to push our less tech-savvy main audience (historians) away with uncontextualized source code, and we wanted the code to be 100% reproducible. To publish the plots including a reproducible workflow – from raw data to a PDF export of each plot – we created the sgb-figures (Twente 2025b) GitHub repository with our template. This repository provides a reproducible environment with raw data and scripts for processing, plotting, annotating, and exporting the available illustrations. Each plot is linked from our research data platform. With the publication of our data and workflow, we made it possible for interested users to tweak parameters, add data, or reuse our dataset for other analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Landing page of the sgb-figures repository, presenting code, data, and documentation for creating plots used in the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel research project.\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible Workflows\nA similar example is a repository containing voting data of members of the Danish Parliament, Folketing. The dataset itself is published in a GitHub repository at mtwente.github.io/nordatlantisk-ft (Twente 2024), including the workflow to scrape the voting data from Folketinget’s API, to combine different variables into one dataset, and to create a few exploratory visualizations. Using the template, we structured the repository according to best practices following an advanced structure recommended by The Turing Way (The Turing Way Community 2025), with a clear folder structure for raw data, processed data, analysis scripts, and documentation, including a codebook for all variables. The site also integrates external resources like a Zotero bibliography of relevant sources, which demonstrates how contextual information can be linked to the dataset. The template’s flexibility allows for including a short descriptive report on the data with self-updating, interactive plots as an integral part of the site, providing an initial overview of the data without delving into the data structure itself. The GitHub repository enables users to rerun the data scraping workflow themselves by making use of both R and GitHub features such as reproducible environments with R targets and Codespaces. Using GitHub Actions, the dataset can be updated at fixed time intervals – including uploads to Zenodo – without the need for manual intervention. By encapsulating this in the template, such maintenance tasks become standardized across projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Data description page of the nordatlantisk-ft project, presenting an overview of the dataset on North Atlantic MPs in the Danish parliament, including data sources and contextual information.\n\n\n\nEven for projects that do not consist of one executable workflow, the template is useful for documenting which steps were taken to compile the research data to be published. Quarto’s multi-language capabilities make it possible to document processing steps in written text, and, using flowcharts, also in a visually appealing way. Take the data repository maxvogt-analysis (Twente and Omonsky 2024) for example. In this project, spatial data and design attributes of railway station architecture in Switzerland were collected to conduct a study in urban design history. While photographs were archived on Wikimedia Commons, a separate location was needed to also store about fifty geojson files to provide results of urban morphology analyses. Using the Quarto template, it was not only possible to check the geodata into version control, but also to provide documentation on the data source and workflow in Markdown. A notable use of the template here was embedding a Mermaid.js diagram outlining the analysis workflow – from data collection to analysis steps – directly in the documentation. This diagram offers a quick visual understanding of how the research was conducted, complementing the textual description. By hosting the data and the Python analysis code together, the site becomes a one-stop resource for others interested in this approach to spatial analysis of architectural history. They can see the exact steps taken, map outputs, and even use the geodata in GIS or for interactive online maps using Leaflet.js.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Workflow diagram of the maxvogt-analysis project, showing data sources, software tools, data storage, and resulting outputs.\n\n\n\nThe possibility to add multimedia content to the research data documentation is also part of the project Modelling Marti (Twente 2025a) – topic modeling for newspaper articles by Hans Marti, a pioneer of spatial planning in Switzerland. While the GitHub repository behind the Quarto website again stores the harvested data – segmented text in txt and csv files, including metadata – it allows for a publication focused on narrative elements and context as well. The site reads like an extended article: It lays out the research questions, methods (article scraping, data cleaning, topic modeling), and the results with exploratory charts and tables. However, unlike a traditional paper, it includes the underlying code for topic modeling or word frequency analysis inline using R, which readers can inspect or even replicate with tweaked parameters. By employing the template, we turned what could have been a static PDF into an interactive publication. Interactive maps using Leaflet.js and historic photographs embedded from ETH Zürich’s e-pics catalogue enhance the reading experience by turning the data repository into a narrative, data-driven publication. It also serves as a proof of concept that academic publications in history can be made more transparent and reproducible without sacrificing narrative clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Overview page of the modelling-marti project, presenting planning projects by Hans Marti and his office, including a map of their geographic distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nConference and Teaching Platforms\nThe Open Research Data Template has proven useful beyond traditional research data documentation – notably in academic event and course contexts. We deployed the template for the Digital History Switzerland 2024 conference (Baudry et al. 2024b). Here, the template was used to publish the book of abstracts (Baudry et al. 2024a) as an interactive digital publication. Each abstract is a short, citable publication with references, some accompanied by dynamically generated visualizations. The site not only provided information to conference attendees but also now serves as a preserved record of the event, with DOIs ensuring each abstract is citable and archived using Zenodo. By using our template, we ensured that the process of compiling, formatting, and publishing the abstracts was largely automated and consistent, enabling researchers unfamiliar with Quarto and markdown to contribute to the book of abstracts. Thanks to the template, we are also independent of the university’s conference management tools, which are not designed to be long-term archivable resource. Presenters submitted their abstracts (some with code snippets, bibliography files, or data links) as Markdown, which we integrated into the Quarto-based site. The inclusion of executable snippets allowed presenters in computational history to share live examples alongside their abstract text, something not possible in a static PDF. This use case demonstrated that the template can handle multi-author content and still maintain overall cohesion and quality control via versioning and automated checks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Landing page of the DigiHistCH24 conference, introducing the theme “Historical Research, Digital Literacy and Algorithmic Criticism” and inviting participation.\n\n\n\nIn a different vein, the Digital Humanities Bern (DH Bern) website (Digital Humanities Bern 2025) was created with the template to serve as a hub for the University of Bern’s DH projects and activities. Unlike the focused research cases above, this website aggregates various content types: blog posts, project descriptions, and event announcements. The template’s flexibility allowed us to support all these content types within one site. For example, the portal features an events calendar (fed by data that can be updated via a simple CSV or Google Sheets and then pulled into the site), and a blog where each post can include interactive elements (one post visualized the timeline of DH projects at the university using an embedded chart). By building the site on the template, the DH Bern team benefits from the same maintainability – any content update triggers a site rebuild, and the site’s static hosting means it is low maintenance. Additionally, the portal harmonizes multiple projects and methodologies under a single framework. For instance, if one project is an online database and another is a mapping tool, their documentation on the portal can both use interactive code cells to show usage examples, providing a unified user experience. The success of this portal indicates that our template can double as a general-purpose static site generator for academic groups, not just data-specific projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Blog and events page of the Digital Humanities department at the University of Bern, featuring news updates and upcoming events.\n\n\n\nWe also created a course website for Decoding Inequality (Huber and Mähr 2024), a university course by Rachel Huber and Moritz Mähr taught at the University of Bern for Digital Humanities students in 2025, using the template. This site hosted lecture notes, datasets for student exercises, and an interactive bibliography on machine learning and social inequality. Moreover, the contributions of the students were uploaded as well, turning the site into a collaborative space. The static nature of the deployed site meant that it was reliable and fast for students to access, and after the course ended, it remains a publicly accessible resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Course description page for Decoding Inequality 2025, outlining the seminar’s critical approach to machine learning systems and their societal impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving Publications and Handbooks\nOne of the most significant outcomes of our work has been the creation of a “living handbook” on Non-discriminatory Metadata (Mähr and Schnegg 2024) for historical collections. This handbook, published in 2024 by Noëlle Schnegg and Moritz Mähr, was built using the template and exemplifies how scholarly documents can remain dynamic. The handbook provides guidelines and case studies on creating inclusive, non-discriminatory metadata in cultural heritage and research contexts. Because it is built with our template, it is not a static PDF but a multiformat publication that can continuously evolve – indeed, it is explicitly intended as a “Living Document” open to continuous community development. The site allows readers to not only read the guidelines but also see examples of metadata records, some of which are interactive (e.g., forms or JSON examples that users can toggle). We included a discussion forum via the GitHub issues integration, inviting feedback or contributions from librarians, archivists, and others in the community. Notably, we took advantage of Quarto’s multi-format output capabilities to release the handbook in multiple formats from the same source: an HTML website, a downloadable PDF, and even a Word document for those who prefer or require that format. All these formats are generated automatically, ensuring consistency across them. The template’s DOI integration was used to archive a version of the handbook on Zenodo at the time of official release, giving it a citable reference. However, the online version continues to be updated with new examples and clarifications as the field evolves. This use case underlines how the template supports sustainability and accessibility: by making the handbook a static site, it remains accessible long-term (no dependency on a complex database or CMS), and by archiving versions, we balance the living nature with scholarly referenceability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Handbook page for creating non-discriminatory metadata for historical sources and research data, developed within the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project.\n\n\n\nFinally, in a meta-turn, we even used the Open Research Data Template to create the presentation site (Mähr and Twente 2025) for this very paper, One Template to Rule Them All. The talk’s slides were prepared in Quarto, allowing us to generate a Reveal.js HTML slideshow for live presentation and a PowerPoint deck for backup, all from the same content source. This demonstrated that the template (and Quarto by extension) can easily switch output formats – in this case, from an interactive website to presentation slides – a boon for efficiency overall. The presentation site itself is hosted on GitHub Pages, and it includes live examples of the template’s features in action. By eating our own dog food, so to speak, in using the template for the talk, we validated its utility in yet another format and identified a few minor improvements (e.g., better default styles for slides) that we subsequently incorporated into the template for future users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Landing page of the One Template to Rule Them All project, presenting a framework for interactive research data documentation with Quarto.\n\n\n\nAcross all these use cases, a pattern emerges: the Open Research Data Template helped make sound RDM and open science practices easier to implement by packaging them into a reusable toolkit. Whether it was a large public history project, a standalone dataset publication, a collaborative handbook, or a course website, the template provided a backbone to ensure that the outputs were accessible, reproducible, and sustainable. Each deployment also fed back into the project – for example, the need to support multiple output formats became clear with the handbook and presentation, which led us to refine how the template’s configuration handled HTML/PDF/Word generation and slides. In this way, continuous use has been a form of continuous development.\n\n\nThe Template’s Role in Peer-Reviewed Scholarship\nA crucial aspect of the Open Research Data Template is its ability to bridge the gap between dynamic, web-based project documentation and formal, peer-reviewed academic outputs. The websites and repositories created with the template are not merely informal supplements; they are integral components of the scholarly record that can complement, facilitate, or even constitute a form of peer-reviewed publication.\nFirst, the template provides a robust framework for creating citable supplementary material that vastly exceed the scope of traditional “supplementary information” files. When a researcher submits a journal article or book chapter based on data analysis, the corresponding template-based website can be cited directly in the publication using its Zenodo-minted DOI. This allows readers to move seamlessly from the static argument in the paper to an interactive environment where they can explore the data, examine the analysis code, and verify the results. This model of publication enhances transparency and reproducibility, allowing peer reviewers and future researchers to engage with the work on a much deeper level than a PDF alone would permit.\nSecond, the template can facilitate a more transparent and rigorous peer-review process. By sharing a link to the repository with reviewers, authors can provide access to the entire research workflow. Reviewers can not only assess the final narrative but also inspect the raw data, run the code in a reproducible environment like a Codespace, and trace the project’s development through its version history. This open approach transforms peer review from a simple evaluation of a final product into a more comprehensive audit of the research process itself, aligning with the growing demand for accountability in computational research.\nFinally, projects built with the template can function as standalone scholarly publications in their own right, challenging traditional publication models. The “living handbook” on Non-discriminatory Metadata (Mähr and Schnegg 2024) serves as a prime example. While it was not subjected to a conventional double-blind peer-review process, its publication on GitHub invites continuous open community review through the platform’s issues and pull request features. This model treats scholarship as an ongoing conversation rather than a finished artifact. Furthermore, the template is ideally suited for producing data and software papers, a growing genre of peer-reviewed articles focused on describing a scholarly resource. The structured documentation, embedded code, and contextual narrative generated by the template provide the exact content required for submission to journals like the Journal of Open Humanities Data. In this context, the template does not just support a publication; it helps generate its core substance. By formalizing the connection between data, process, and narrative, the template helps legitimize these essential research outputs as first-class academic contributions.",

    "text": "Conclusion\nOur experience with the Stadt.Geschichte.Basel project and the subsequent development of the Open Research Data Template highlights the value of making robust, interactive documentation a standard component of research data management. By lowering technical barriers, we made it as easy as possible for researchers (and ourselves) to follow best practices in open data: the template abstracts the complexities of web publishing, reproducibility, and archiving into a user-friendly workflow. This means historians and humanities scholars – who might not be seasoned programmers – can still produce state-of-the-art research outputs that are transparent and reusable. Crucially, the use of static-site technology (Quarto + GitHub Pages) contributes to sustainability (noting that while we do lock into the Microsoft universe by using GitHub as a platform, we also help cement its place as a de facto marketplace for open source code). Static sites are lightweight, secure (no moving parts on the server), and likely to remain accessible years into the future with minimal maintenance. They can be archived in repositories like Zenodo, preserving not just the data but the complete context needed to understand and reuse that data.\nIn sum, good interactive documentation is not an added bonus but a fundamental part of making research data truly open and useful. Our template empowers projects to create “living” documentation that keeps data, code, and narrative in sync, which we believe is a key ingredient for impactful and reproducible Digital Humanities research. The positive reception and diverse adoption of the template across use cases indicate that this approach resonates with the needs of the community. We argue that initiatives like ours help shift the culture toward treating research outputs as dynamic resources to be explored and built upon, rather than static end products. By combining modern open-source tools and best practices, and by focusing on ease of use, we hope to see more researchers embrace these methods. Ultimately, making open research data practices easy and even automatic frees scholars to focus on the content of their research, while ensuring that their work can endure, be understood, and inspire future work in the years to come.",

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThe template has evolved through several distinct phases. The project’s foundation was established in early 2023 with the creation of the initial template, core documentation and Zenodo integration for archiving purposes. This was followed by a phase of enhancements focusing on bug fixes, improving user instructions and managing dependency updates. From late 2023 to mid-2024, the project underwent a period of major evolution, including renaming, adopting a dual AGPL-3.0 and CC BY 4.0 licence, and switching to Quarto as the primary documentation system. In early 2025, DevOps processes were improved with enhanced GitHub Actions workflows for automated linting and deployment. Most recently, in mid-2025, a modern development phase introduced DevContainer support and GitHub Codespaces integration to streamline the development environment. The template is now stable, with a v1.0.0 release planned for the fourth quarter of 2025. Planned future changes include adding instructions for GitHub Copilot.↩︎\nA migration to GitLab is technically feasible. Core repository data (files, history, issues, wikis) can be imported with low effort, but continuous integration workflows require a full rewrite of GitHub Actions into GitLab’s .gitlab-ci.yml. Dependency updates, security scanning, and GitHub Pages equivalents also need reconfiguration.↩︎",

    "text": "This repository contains the presentation materials for “One Template to Rule Them All: Interactive Research Data Documentation with Quarto” presented by Moritz Mähr and Moritz Twente at the Digital Humanities Tech Symposium (DHTech), held during DH2025 at NOVA University, Lisbon, Portugal.\nThe DHTech Symposium, a mini-conference embedded within DH2025 (July 14–18, 2025), provides a venue to foreground technical innovation and infrastructure in digital humanities research. Unlike typical DH conferences that prioritize research outcomes over technical process, the DHTech Symposium emphasizes the tools, platforms, and methodologies that underpin digital scholarship.\nOur contribution introduces the Open Research Data Template, a GitHub-based framework designed to streamline the publication and reuse of open research data through executable, interactive documentation using Quarto. The template supports integration of narrative, metadata, and code in Python, R, Julia, and ObservableJS, enabling researchers to publish cohesive, reproducible, and FAIR-compliant websites directly from their project repositories.\nWe discuss how the template lowers barriers to reuse and sustainable archiving of research workflows by automating documentation pipelines and facilitating seamless publishing. Real-world applications from projects such as DigiHistCH24, Stadt.Geschichte.Basel, DHBern, and Decoding Inequality 2025 are presented to demonstrate its flexibility across domains and use cases.\nThe presentation covers:\n\nThe motivation and need for executable research data documentation in DH.\nThe structure and technical implementation of the template using Quarto and GitHub Actions.\nAutomation strategies for multi-language code integration and metadata harmonization.\nSustainable publishing practices for archiving and interoperability.\nLive demonstrations and case studies.\n\nLinks\n\nDigital Humanities Tech Symposium Agenda\nDH2025, NOVA University Lisbon\n\nThis repository includes slides, demo notebooks, and reference materials to support the talk and foster adoption of the Open Research Data Template in DH and adjacent fields.\n\n\nThe structure of this repository follows the Advanced Structure for Data Analysis of The Turing Way and is organized as follows:\n\nabstract/: Contains the abstract for the DHTech Symposium, including the extended abstract and any supplementary materials.\ndocumentation/: Contains the Quarto documentation files for the Open Research Data Template, including the main presentation slides and demo notebooks.\npaper/: Contains the paper files for the DHTech Symposium, including the LaTeX source and any supplementary materials.\npresentation/: Contains the presentation files for the DHTech Symposium, including the Quarto slides and any supplementary materials.\n\n\n\n\nInstall uv to install the dependencies and run the presentation locally:\nuv sync\nuv run playwright install\n\n\n\nThese resources are openly available to everyone and can be used for any research or educational purpose.

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
