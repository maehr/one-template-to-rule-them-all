This repository contains the presentation materials for **"One Template to Rule Them All: Interactive Research Data Documentation with Quarto"** presented by Moritz M√§hr and Moritz Twente at the **Digital Humanities Tech Symposium** (DHTech), held during DH2025 at NOVA University, Lisbon, Portugal.

The DHTech Symposium, a mini-conference embedded within DH2025 (July 14‚Äì18, 2025), provides a venue to foreground technical innovation and infrastructure in digital humanities research. Unlike typical DH conferences that prioritize research outcomes over technical process, the DHTech Symposium emphasizes the tools, platforms, and methodologies that underpin digital scholarship.

Our contribution introduces the **Open Research Data Template**, a GitHub-based framework designed to streamline the publication and reuse of open research data through executable, interactive documentation using Quarto. The template supports integration of narrative, metadata, and code in Python, R, Julia, and ObservableJS, enabling researchers to publish cohesive, reproducible, and FAIR-compliant websites directly from their project repositories.

We discuss how the template lowers barriers to reuse and sustainable archiving of research workflows by automating documentation pipelines and facilitating seamless publishing. Real-world applications from projects such as **DigiHistCH24**, **Stadt.Geschichte.Basel**, **DHBern**, and **Decoding Inequality 2025** are presented to demonstrate its flexibility across domains and use cases.

The presentation covers:

- The motivation and need for executable research data documentation in DH.
- The structure and technical implementation of the template using Quarto and GitHub Actions.
- Automation strategies for multi-language code integration and metadata harmonization.
- Sustainable publishing practices for archiving and interoperability.
- Live demonstrations and case studies.
